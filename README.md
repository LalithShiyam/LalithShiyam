# üåü Fun Facts

1. üéì My educational journey is quite the rollercoaster: I started with a bachelor's in Biotechnology, then switched gears with a master's in Biomedical Engineering, and finally got a PhD in Medical Physics. I guess you could say I'm a bit of an academic thrill-seeker!
2. üñ•Ô∏è I once worked as a mainframe programmer, which is where I accidentally tripped, fell, and landed head-over-heels in love with coding.
3. üçΩÔ∏è I'm a foodie who loves cooking almost as much as I love learning. My kitchen experiments can sometimes rival my scientific ones!
4. üêª "nutellabear" is my affectionate nickname from colleagues, thanks to my insatiable appetite for Nutella and my skin color. Who can resist that chocolatey-hazelnut goodness?
5. üè∏ When I'm not busy collecting degrees or coding, you can find me on the badminton or cricket court, serving up some friendly competition.
6. üåç I've worked in Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria, embracing my love for international adventures both inside and outside the lab.
